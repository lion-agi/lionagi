       "  \n",
       "  ### 1. Set Up Your Environment\n",
       "  - **Install Required Packages**: Make sure you have FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and a database driver (e.g., `asyncpg` for PostgreSQL) installed.\n",
       "  \n",
       "    ```bash\n",
       "    pip install fastapi[all] sqlalchemy asyncpg\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 2. Define Your Database Models\n",
       "  - **SQLAlchemy Models Setup**: Use SQLAlchemy to define your database structure. Here is an example user model:\n",
       "  \n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "    from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, create_engine\n",
       "    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
       "  \n",

       "        email = Column(String, unique=True, index=True)\n",
       "    ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 3. Configure the Database\n",
       "  - **Database Connection**: Use SQLAlchemy to configure the asynchronous database connection.\n",
       "  \n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "    from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession, create_async_engine\n",
       "    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\n",
       "  \n",

       "    ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 4. Create the FastAPI App and Endpoint\n",
       "  - **FastAPI Endpoint**: Define the endpoint to retrieve users.\n",
       "  \n",
       "    ```python\n",
       "    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends\n",
       "    from sqlalchemy.exc import SQLAlchemyError\n",
       "    from sqlalchemy.future import select\n",

       "    async def get_db() -> AsyncSession:\n",
       "        async with async_session() as session:\n",

       "    ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 5. Implement Error Handling\n",
       "  - **Error Handling**: Use `HTTPException` to handle cases where the database connection fails or other SQLAlchemy-related errors occur. This ensures the application can gracefully handle and report errors.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 6. Consider Scalability and Maintainability\n",
       "  - **Scalability**: To handle an increasing number of requests efficiently, ensure your application is deployed using a server that supports ASGI, such as Uvicorn or Daphne.\n",
       "    \n",
       "  - **Maintainability**: Keep your FastAPI project structured modularly, separating database models, configuration, and routes for better readability and future enhancements.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 7. Test Your Endpoint\n",
       "  - Make sure to extensively test the endpoint to confirm it operates correctly and gracefully handles database disruption scenarios. \n",

       "  \n",
       "  1. **Token Generation:** Utilizes JWT for generating and validating access tokens. The `SECRET_KEY` and `ALGORITHM` ensure token security.\n",
       "     \n",
       "  2. **User Authentication:** Includes a simple user authentication flow with in-memory user data, using `OAuth2PasswordBearer` for handling token-based authentication.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  3. **Protected Endpoint:** The `/protected-resource/` endpoint is accessible only with a valid token, displaying the `current_user` information as demonstration.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  4. **Password Security:** This example uses plain string comparison (`verify_password`) for simplicity but should be replaced with hashed password verification in a production setup, typically implemented using libraries like `bcrypt`.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  5. **Security Best Practices:** \n",
       "     - Always store passwords securely using hashing algorithms.\n",
       "     - Ensure your `SECRET_KEY` is complex and confidential.\n",
       "     - Use HTTPS in production to protect token exchange.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  This setup demonstrates basic integration of OAuth2 in FastAPI for securing endpoints and validates the ability to implement practical and secure authentication mechanisms.\n",

       "    ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  - Use the `/token` endpoint to obtain a JWT by submitting a form with `username` and `password` fields.\n",
       "  - Access the protected `/protected-resource/` endpoint using the retrieved JWT by setting it in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### 4. Security Considerations\n",
       "  \n",
       "  - **HTTPS:** Ensure that the application runs over HTTPS in production to maintain secure data transmission.\n",
       "  - **Secret Key:** Use a complex and secure key for `SECRET_KEY` to prevent token cracking.\n",
       "  - **Password Hashing:** Passwords should always be hashed using a secure hashing algorithm, with `bcrypt` being an industry standard.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  This example demonstrates a secure and maintainable approach to implementing authentication in a FastAPI application using OAuth2. It showcases the use of password hashing for secure storage and JWT for authentication.\n",
